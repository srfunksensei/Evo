# Software Evolution - Refactoring 

 The existing larger system is never complete and continues to evolve. As it evolves, the complexity of the system will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring the reliability and flexibility of the system.
 
 As software evolves over time, there are various techniques to reduce complexity and make it easier to maintain. This two project cover one part of improving code quality.

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `Android` directory contains code before and after refactoring of existing android app using eclipse built-in helpers
- `jDeodorant` directory contains code before and after refactoring using jDeodorant plug-in for code smell identification
